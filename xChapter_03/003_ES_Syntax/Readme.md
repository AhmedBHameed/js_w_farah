# ES Syntax

Syntax defines the set of rules for writing programs. Every language specification defines its own syntax.

A JavaScript program can be composed of:

- Variables: Represents a named memory block that can store values for the program.
- Literals: Represents constant/fixed values.
- Operators: Symbols that define how the operands will be processed.
- Keywords: Words that have a special meaning in the context of a language.
- Modules: Represents programs/scripts.
- Comments: Used to improve code readability. These are ignored by the JavaScript engine.
- Identifiers: These are the names given to elements in a program like variables, functions, etc. `identifiers` conditions will explain in the next chapter.

It is good to know that JavaScript is `Case-Sensitive` which mean that `firstname` is not equal to `firstName`.

## Let's write our first code

Simple program to print hello world.

```js
var message = "Hello World";
console.log(message);
```

## Executing the Code

- :abc: Create a new directory with new file called hello_world.js
- :abc: Save the code into the file hello_world.js with you VSCode
- :abc: Go to `Terminal` inside VSCode
- :abc: Run `node hello_world.js`.
