# Arrays

An array is a special type of variable. It doesn't just store one value, it stores a list of values.

## When to use array

You should consider using an array whenever you are working with a `list` or a set of values that are `related` to each other.

It is useful when you want to create a list of `n` values. Which array is not limited to a number of values in your list.

## Create an array

```js
// Ahmed write them c02/js/array-literal Program
```

## Values in array and accessing them

Values in an array are accessed as if they are in a numbered list. It is important to know that the numbering of this list **starts at zero** (not one).

```js
// Ahmed write them c02/js/update-array program
```
